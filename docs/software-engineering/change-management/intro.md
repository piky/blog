:::tip Rule-of-Thumb
* Declare runtime variables and constants in source code while iterating.
* Configure environment variables for dynamics changes.
* Keep sensitive variables as a secret.
* Do commit regularly for small changes or continuous improvements.
* Create a new branch for proof-of-concept or try something new.
