:::tip Rule-of-Thumb
* Declare runtime variables and constants in source code while iterating.
* Configure environment variables for dynamics changes.
* Keep potential sensitive variables as the secrets.
* Do commit for small changes or continuous improvements.
* Create new branch for proof-of-concept or try something new.
