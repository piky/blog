**Day-0** : define, design, modelling (i.e. Design Thinking)
**Day-1** : development, installation, configuration, deployment (i.e. CI/CD)
**Day-2** : re-configuration, update, backup, failover, restore, etc. (Conflict need phase. extensible but efficient and reliable)  
FYI, instead of `Day`, it should be `Phase` in terms of project management life cycle.
