    I am a tech enthusiast who is passionate about Cloud and Cybersecurity. I help people turn their idea into a product. 
    I bring feedback into the development teams for quick and quality product delivery. I am anti-cognitive load that's why I enjoy writing articles and tutorials to help others learn and grow in their careers.  
    I have been working with SOTA generative AI for couple of years.
